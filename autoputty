Automating PuTTY UI interaction without opening the PuTTY application itself can be achieved by using the Plink utility, which is a command-line interface to PuTTY. Plink allows you to automate SSH connections and execute commands on a remote system without the need for a GUI. To interact with a remote system using PuTTY UI commands through Plink without opening the PuTTY application, you can follow these general steps:

1. Use Plink to establish an SSH connection to the remote system.
2. Send commands or scripts to the remote system for execution.

Below is an example of how you can achieve this using the ProcessBuilder in Java:

```java
try {
    String hostname = "your_remote_host"; // Replace with the hostname or IP address of the remote system
    String username = "your_username"; // Replace with your username on the remote system
    String password = "your_password"; // Replace with your password (consider more secure methods such as SSH keys)
    String command = "ls"; // Replace with the command you want to execute
    
    ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("plink", "-ssh", username + "@" + hostname, "-pw", password, command);
    pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
    Process process = pb.start();
    
    // Read the output of the process and handle it as needed
    InputStream inputStream = process.getInputStream();
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line); // Output the result of the command execution
    }
    // Optionally, you can wait for the process to complete
    int exitCode = process.waitFor();
    System.out.println("Process exited with code: " + exitCode);
    
} catch (IOException | InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this example, replace "your_remote_host" with the actual hostname or IP address of the remote system, "your_username" with your username, and "your_password" with your password (consider more secure methods such as SSH keys or environment variables).

You can also replace "ls" with the actual command you want to execute on the remote system. Please note that handling passwords in this manner may not be the most secure approach, and using SSH keys or other secure methods for authentication is highly recommended.

This approach allows you to automate interactions with the remote system using PuTTY commands without the need to open the PuTTY application on the local machine. However, please be aware that directly interacting with UI elements of PuTTY remotely may have limitations and security implications. For more complex or interactive scenarios, consider utilizing dedicated tools or APIs designed for remote system management and automation. Always ensure that your automation solutions align with security best practices and organizational policies.
