Certainly! You can use the ProcessBuilder class in Java to execute a .txt or .sh file on a remote server using Plink with an SSH saved session that includes a password. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```java
try {
    String sessionName = "your_saved_session_name"; // Replace with the name of your saved session in PuTTY
    String password = "your_password"; // Replace with the actual password for the saved session

    // For .txt File
    ProcessBuilder pbTxt = new ProcessBuilder("plink", "-load", sessionName, "-pw", password, "cat /path/to/script.txt");
    pbTxt.redirectErrorStream(true);
    Process processTxt = pbTxt.start();
    // Handle the process output for .txt file as needed

    // For .sh File
    ProcessBuilder pbSh = new ProcessBuilder("plink", "-load", sessionName, "-pw", password, "bash /path/to/script.sh");
    pbSh.redirectErrorStream(true);
    Process processSh = pbSh.start();
    // Handle the process output for .sh file as needed
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

In this code snippet, you can use the "-load" option with the name of the saved session in PuTTY to establish an SSH connection using the stored session details. Additionally, you can use the "-pw" option to specify the password for the saved session in Plink.

Replace "your_saved_session_name" with the actual name of the saved session in PuTTY and "your_password" with the actual password for the saved session.

Also, replace "/path/to/script.txt" with the actual path to the .txt file on the remote server, and "/path/to/script.sh" with the actual path to the .sh file on the remote server.

By using the stored session and password, you can establish an SSH connection and execute the script files without needing to provide the username and password directly within the Java code.

Always handle exceptions and add appropriate error checking to ensure the robustness of the code when using ProcessBuilder to execute Plink commands. Additionally, ensure that the stored session in PuTTY contains the required authentication details and settings for the remote SSH connection.
